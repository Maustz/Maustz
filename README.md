Hello there! I'm thrilled to welcome you to my coding journey as a third-year student diving headfirst into the captivating realms of Java and Python. I'm here to share my experiences, challenges, and triumphs as I navigate the exciting world of programming while pursuing my academic goals.

I'm Augustu III E. Mantilla, a passionate and curious individual currently in my third year of BSIT at St. Paul University Surigao. My journey into the world of coding began as a personal curiosity, and it has since evolved into a defining aspect of my academic and professional aspirations.
